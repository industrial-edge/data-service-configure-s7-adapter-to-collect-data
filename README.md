## Description

### Overview

This document describes how to get the data from a PLC into the app Data Service, prepare the data and store timeseries for further usage.
A properly configured Data Service is the basis for using other Industrial Edge Apps (e.g. Performance Insight or Notifier).

### General task

The example reads data from a PLC via the S7 Connector (OPC UA).
The data is published on the IE Databus, where the Data Service can collect the needed shopfloor data.
First an adapter for providing the datapoints must be assigned and configured.
Afterwards the data structure can be modeled using assets and aspects.
Assets are used to structure the plant in logical units.
Within an asset you can create variables and link them to the appropriate datapoints, which are made available by the configured adapter.
This data is collected, saved for individual time period and transfered for further processing.
By creating an aspect, variables can be grouped to a logical unit.

## Requirements

###  Prerequisities

- Access to an Industrial Edge Management System (IEM)
- Onboarded Industial Edge Device on IEM
- Installed System Configurators for Databus and S7 Connector
- Installed System Apps Databus and S7 Connector
- Installed Data Service
- Edge device is connected to PLC
- TIA portal project loaded on PLC
- HTML5-capable Internet browser

### Used components

- Industrial Edge Management V1.2.0-36 / V1.2.14
  - IE Databus V1.2.16
  - IE Databus Configurator V1.2.23
  - S7 Connector V1.2.26
  - S7 Connector Configurator V1.2.32
  - Data Service V1.2.0
- Industrial Edge Device V 1.2.0-56
- TIA Portal V16
- S7-PLCSIM Advanced V3.0

### TIA Project

The used TIA Portal project can be found in the miscellaneous repository under "[tank application](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous/tree/main/tank%20application)".

## Configuration steps

You can find the further information about the following steps in the [docs](docs/Installation.md)
- Configure PLC Connection (Databus, S7 Connector)
- Configure Data Service

## Usage

Once the Data Service app is configured and data is availalbe from a running PLC, process data can be collected.
Now the data can be used to feed other apps like Performance Insight or Notifier.
